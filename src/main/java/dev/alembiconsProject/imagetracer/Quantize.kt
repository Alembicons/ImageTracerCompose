    %
    %  Realism in computer graphics typically requires using 24 bits/pixel to
    %  generate an image. Yet many graphic display devices do not contain
    %  the amount of memory necessary to match the spatial and color
    %  resolution of the human eye. The QUANTIZE program takes a 24 bit
    %  image and reduces the number of colors so it can be displayed on
    %  raster device with less bits per pixel. In most instances, the
    %  quantized image closely resembles the original reference image.
    %
    %  A reduction of colors in an image is also desirable for image
    %  transmission and real-time animation.
    %
    %  Function Quantize takes a standard RGB or monochrome images and quantizes
    %  them down to some fixed number of colors.
    %
    %  For purposes of color allocation, an image is a set of n pixels, where
    %  each pixel is a point in RGB space. RGB space is a 3-dimensional
    %  vector space, and each pixel, pi, is defined by an ordered triple of
    %  red, green, and blue coordinates, (ri, gi, bi).
    %
    %  Each primary color component (red, green, or blue) represents an
    %  intensity which varies linearly from 0 to a maximum value, cmax, which
    %  corresponds to full saturation of that color. Color allocation is
    %  defined over a domain consisting of the cube in RGB space with
    %  opposite vertices at (0,0,0) and (cmax,cmax,cmax). QUANTIZE requires
    %  cmax = 255.
    %
    %  The algorithm maps this domain onto a tree in which each node
    %  represents a cube within that domain. In the following discussion
    %  these cubes are defined by the coordinate of two opposite vertices:
    %  The vertex nearest the origin in RGB space and the vertex farthest
    %  from the origin.
    %
    %  The tree's root node represents the the entire domain, (0,0,0) through
    %  (cmax,cmax,cmax). Each lower level in the tree is generated by
    %  subdividing one node's cube into eight smaller cubes of equal size.
    %  This corresponds to bisecting the parent cube with planes passing
    %  through the midpoints of each edge.
    %
    %  The basic algorithm operates in three phases: Classification,
    %  Reduction, and Assignment. Classification builds a color
    %  description tree for the image. Reduction collapses the tree until
    %  the number it represents, at most, the number of colors desired in the
    %  output image. Assignment defines the output image's color map and
    %  sets each pixel's color by reclassification in the reduced tree.
    %  Our goal is to minimize the numerical discrepancies between the original
    %  colors and quantized colors (quantization error).
    %
    %  Classification begins by initializing a color description tree of
    %  sufficient depth to represent each possible input color in a leaf.
    %  However, it is impractical to generate a fully-formed color
    %  description tree in the classification phase for realistic values of
    %  cmax. If colors components in the input image are quantized to k-bit
    %  precision, so that cmax= 2k-1, the tree would need k levels below the
    %  root node to allow representing each possible input color in a leaf.
    %  This becomes prohibitive because the tree's total number of nodes is
    %  1 + sum(i=1,k,8k).
    %
    %  A complete tree would require 19,173,961 nodes for k = 8, cmax = 255.
    %  Therefore, to avoid building a fully populated tree, QUANTIZE: (1)
    %  Initializes data structures for nodes only as they are needed;  (2)
    %  Chooses a maximum depth for the tree as a function of the desired
    %  number of colors in the output image (currently log2(colormap size)).
    %
    %  For each pixel in the input image, classification scans downward from
    %  the root of the color description tree. At each level of the tree it
    %  identifies the single node which represents a cube in RGB space
    %  containing the pixel's color. It updates the following data for each
    %  such node:
    %
    %    n1: Number of pixels whose color is contained in the RGB cube
    %    which this node represents;
    %
    %    n2: Number of pixels whose color is not represented in a node at
    %    lower depth in the tree;  initially,  n2 = 0 for all nodes except
    %    leaves of the tree.
    %
    %    Sr, Sg, Sb: Sums of the red, green, and blue component values for
    %    all pixels not classified at a lower depth. The combination of
    %    these sums and n2  will ultimately characterize the mean color of a
    %    set of pixels represented by this node.
    %
    %    E: The distance squared in RGB space between each pixel contained
    %    within a node and the nodes' center. This represents the quantization
    %    error for a node.
    %
    %  Reduction repeatedly prunes the tree until the number of nodes with
    %  n2 > 0 is less than or equal to the maximum number of colors allowed
    %  in the output image. On any given iteration over the tree, it selects
    %  those nodes whose E count is minimal for pruning and merges their
    %  color statistics upward. It uses a pruning threshold, Ep, to govern
    %  node selection as follows:
    %
    %    Ep = 0
    %    while number of nodes with (n2 > 0) > required maximum number of colors
    %      prune all nodes such that E <= Ep
    %      Set Ep to minimum E in remaining nodes
    %
    %  This has the effect of minimizing any quantization error when merging
    %  two nodes together.
    %
    %  When a node to be pruned has offspring, the pruning procedure invokes
    %  itself recursively in order to prune the tree from the leaves upward.
    %  n2,  Sr, Sg,  and  Sb in a node being pruned are always added to the
    %  corresponding data in that node's parent. This retains the pruned
    %  node's color characteristics for later averaging.
    %
    %  For each node, n2 pixels exist for which that node represents the
    %  smallest volume in RGB space containing those pixel's colors. When n2
    %  > 0 the node will uniquely define a color in the output image. At the
    %  beginning of reduction,  n2 = 0  for all nodes except a the leaves of
    %  the tree which represent colors present in the input image.
    %
    %  The other pixel count, n1, indicates the total number of colors
    %  within the cubic volume which the node represents. This includes n1 -
    %  n2  pixels whose colors should be defined by nodes at a lower level in
    %  the tree.
    %
    %  Assignment generates the output image from the pruned tree. The
    %  output image consists of two parts: (1)  A color map, which is an
    %  array of color descriptions (RGB triples) for each color present in
    %  the output image;  (2)  A pixel array, which represents each pixel as
    %  an index into the color map array.
    %
    %  First, the assignment phase makes one pass over the pruned color
    %  description tree to establish the image's color map. For each node
    %  with n2  > 0, it divides Sr, Sg, and Sb by n2 . This produces the
    %  mean color of all pixels that classify no lower than this node. Each
    %  of these colors becomes an entry in the color map.
    %
    %  Finally,  the assignment phase reclassifies each pixel in the pruned
    %  tree to identify the deepest node containing the pixel's color. The
    %  pixel's value in the pixel array becomes the index of this node's mean
    %  color in the color map.
